# Simulation results of the ConNIS approach and competiting methods

This repository contains all results of the simulation study, i.e. results of
 * 216 synthetic data settings 
 * 4 semi-synthetic data settings
 * 1 real word data settings

as well as all scripts necessary to re-run the simulations (we set seeds to gurantee reproducibility) and the Shiny app server.R and ui.R files for plotting.

The methods under consideration are a binomial approach, a bimodal distribution formed by a exponential and a gamma distribution, InsDens, Tn5gap and ConNIS.
